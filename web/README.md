# Elm app for bitcoin-rate

This is a simple `elm` application to display the Bitcoin rate from _CoinDesk.com_.

## How To Run It

### Run The HTTP Server

```bash
stack build && stack exec bitcoin-rate-exe
```

You should see the following:

```bash
Listening on port 3000
```

To test the HTTP server, visit this URL: `http://localhost:3000/bitcoin-rate`

### Run The `Elm` Frontend

#### `Elm` Is Installed

If you have `elm` installed on your machine, run the following command:

```bash
cd web && elm reactor
```

You should see the following:

```bash
Go to http://localhost:8000 to see your project dashboard.
```

Open the URL in your browser. Navigate and locate `src/Main.elm`, click on it and `elm` will render the application.

#### `Elm` Is Not Installed

Otherwise, if you don't have `elm` set up on your machine, you need to _serve_ the file[^1]. If you have `python`, run the following:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7800
```
Go to `http://localhost:7800` on your browser and it should work.
